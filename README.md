## Description:

I have implemented this clone with the help of ReactJS, styling is done with styled Components and the images, videos, gif, etc. are stored locally. This application is to demonstrate my skills in ReactJS. I have also hosted this application with the use of Firebase.

### Modifications which I am working on:
- To store all the images on the cloud and then present them.
- To add user authentication.

## Demo app:
